Hi!

# Comments

* It's my first time Lumen + Doctrine experience (yeah, I heard about it but don't use). It's very similar to Laravel but have some nuances, thanx to stackoverflow and official documentation. Last 3-4 years I worked only with Laravel + Eloquent
* I manually generated migrations for tables, but I think it can be done through artisan doctrine commands using existed models (app/Database/Entities/MailChimp/*), isn't it?
* Worked time is about 5 hours
* I don't write any new tests, because I need time to implementing another test tasks for another position. If you want to see my PHPunit tests please see public links I written bellow.
* s4urp8n@yandex.ru
* Good luck!
